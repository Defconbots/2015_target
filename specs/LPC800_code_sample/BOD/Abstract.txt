Purpose:
Simple BOD program

Running mode:
* Compile, Flash the program and reset.
* Default project target set to BOD_Release (exectuing from flash)
* Can the run project from RAM by setting project target to BOD_Debug

Note:
LPC800 running at 24 MHz


Output:
Following port pins indicate: 
P0.1 is for POR reset 
P0.2 is for BOD interrupt
P0_0 is for BOD reset

(1) POR LED should blink on after power cycle.
(2) when voltage(VDD) falls to the BOD interrupt level, P0.2 (BOD Interrupt) will be set, and P0.1(POR reset) will go low. 
(3) when voltage raises, P0.2 (BOD Interrupt) will go off, and P0.1(POR reset) will blink back on again. 
(4) when voltage drops further to the BOD RESET, P0.0 (BOD RESET) will blink. 
(5) Once it happens, BOD interrupt is disabled. */
